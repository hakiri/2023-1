    <p align="justify"> ISORC will organize a special session dedicated to posters and demos, where the objective is to allow participants to show prototypes, tools, simulators, and systems, which demonstrate the applicability of real-time computing to different applications.
        This session will enable presenters to demonstrate their work and contact directly with potential users of their technology, fostering new collaborations and promoting the adoption of new frameworks. We specially encourage the submission of results
        from finished or ongoing projects, demos of their use-cases and products. </p>

    <div class="subTitle">Submission Guidelines </div>
    <p align="justify"> Authors should submit a 2 page extended abstract describing the poster and an optional demonstration, in the IEEE Conference Proceedings format. The IEEE conference paper templates can be found <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">
            here </a>.<br /> The program committee will review the abstracts and decide on the adequacy of the demo/poster to the conference audience. Reviews are single-blinded. Accepted abstracts will appear in the conference proceedings, and highly-rated
        posters invited to submit a full paper to a special issue of Elsevier Journal of Systems Architecture (JSA).
        <br /> The session will consist of two parts: (i) a short presentation session where each participant can present slides on their demo/poster, followed by (ii) a demonstration and poster session where participants can display their work and discuss
        it with the attendees.<br /> Extended abstracts are to be submitted through HoTCRP at <a href="https://isorc20-ip.mpi-sws.org">https://isorc20-ip.mpi-sws.org</a>.<br /> All accepted poster/demo papers should be accompanied by a regular non-student
        registration. One of the authors of the poster/demo must attend and present their work at the conference.<br />
